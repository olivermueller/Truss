# Truss app
TrussApp is a workplace training app prototype used in the context of assembling a truss connection. The app is used simultaneously by a trainer and a trainee on two separate mobile devices - the trainee has to complete certain tasks while the trainer decides wether the tasks completed by the trainee are correct.  

The app is developed in [Unity (2018.2.20f1)](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) with the built in [Vuforia Augmented Reality](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality) package and the [Multiplayer High Level API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetUsingHLAPI.html).

### Usage
The application establishes a connection between the trainer and trainee over a network - so, before starting the training scenario the two have to be connected to the same lobby. The lobby is created when the trainer presses the "I am a trainer" button. (Figure 1).

Then, the trainee can join by pressing the "I am a trainee" button, fill in the code that appears on the trainer side (see image above) and press next.
